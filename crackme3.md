After few run I relize that it just need to change some code to make program run normal.

First is the 1st nag screen, just need to change the `jump` and make the `jump` is taken and run over the nag message.

Second is the register part, change the `jump` command to make the `jump` not taken like this.

Finally is the 2nd nag screen, just remove the command to pop the message like this.

And here is the result, no more nag screen and status is registered.
